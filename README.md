## Important Considerations
Large language models like (LLM) can sometimes generate incorrect, misleading, or even harmful text.
It is crucial to implement safeguards and carefully monitor the model's output, especially in sensitive applications.
Find an implementation example of this kind of safeguard illustrated in the section 2.8 of this content, using Perspective API.
